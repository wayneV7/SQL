--CREATING TEMPORAL TABLES

/*A system-versioned temporal table is a type of user table
   designed to keep a full history of data changes and allow easy point in time analysis.

  Every temporal table has two explicitly defined columns, each with a datetime2 data type.
  These columns are referred to as period columns. 
  These period columns are used exclusively by the system to record period of validity for each row whenever a row is modified.


  In addition to these period columns, a temporal table also contains a reference to another table with a mirrored schema.
   The system uses this table to automatically store the previous version of the row each time a row in the temporal table gets updated ordeleted.
    This additional table is referred to as the history table,
	 while the main table that stores current (actual) row versions is referred to as the current table or simply as the temporal table.
	 
 During temporal table creation users can specify existing history table (must be schema compliant) or let system create default history table

--EXAMPLE:

CREATE TABLE dbo.Employee   
(    
    [EmployeeID] int IDENTITY NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED      
  , [AnnualSalary] decimal (10,2) NOT NULL 
   
  , [ValidFrom] datetime2 (2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW START  --Period start column: The system records the start time for the row in this column,                                                              typically denoted as the SysStartTime column.

  , [ValidTo] datetime2 (2) GENERATED ALWAYS AS ROW END      --Period end column: The system records the end time for the row in this column,                                                                typically denoted at the SysEndTime column.
  , PERIOD FOR SYSTEM_TIME (ValidFrom, ValidTo)  
 )    
 WITH (SYSTEM_VERSIONING = ON (HISTORY_TABLE = dbo.EmployeeHistory));
